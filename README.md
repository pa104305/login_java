# LOGIN APP IN JAVA

This app is developed to practice the use of Java lang, as is habit, I develop a login in this lang
to practice te logic and use the basic sintax, this app don't contain a GUI, this app is runned in
CLI, because I did start this project I need to practice the basic sintax, in that moment this program
was the most adequate for my learn needs, but I forgot the project leving in this state, and in this moment
i don't want to change more this project.

The only dependency of this project is java installed in your computer, because this app is the source code
you can require to execute the soruce code to see its functionality.
For download this app need to execute the following command: `git clone https://github.com/pa104305/login_java`
